Changing shell for mpendlebury.
The $ZSH folder already exists (/home/mpendlebury/.oh-my-zsh).

You ran the installer with the $ZSH setting or the $ZSH variable is
exported. You have 3 options:

1. Unset the ZSH variable when calling the installer:
   `ZSH= sh install.sh`
2. Install Oh My Zsh to a directory that doesn't exist yet:
   `ZSH=path/to/new/ohmyzsh/folder sh install.sh`
3. (Caution) If the folder doesn't contain important information,
   you can just remove it with `rm -r /home/mpendlebury/.oh-my-zsh`
